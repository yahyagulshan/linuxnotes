# Step 1: Create a New Branch for Reverting
* When you need to revert changes in GitHub, the process should begin by creating a new branch to manage the reversion.

# Step 2: Push the Changes to the Remote Repository
* After creating the new branch, push these changes to the remote GitHub repository.

# Step 3: Create a Pull Request
* To initiate the reversion, create a pull request that involves merging the changes from the new branch to the old branch.

# Step 4: Resolve Conflicts
* During the pull request process, ensure you check for any conflicts that may arise. Resolve conflicts as needed.

# Step 5: Commit the Changes
* Once conflicts have been addressed, commit the changes to the repository.

# Step 6: Reverting Changes
* If you encounter issues or conflicts as a result of the new push changes, you can revert back the changes.

# Step 7: Use GitHub's Revert Feature
* Access the GitHub remote repository, go to the pull request section, and select the closed pull request you wish to revert.

# Step 8: Click on the Revert Button
* By clicking the "Revert" button, GitHub will automatically create a new pull request to revert the changes.

# Step 9: Provide Clear Comments
* To ensure understanding for future reference, be sure to provide clear and informative comments when creating the new pull request for reverting changes.
